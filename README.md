For my project, I decided to do a Luxury Car Rental system. I chose this because I like cars and it seemed like a fun thing to base a project on. Luckily for me, I have a cousin who lives in Texas, and he works for a luxury car rental place as a rental agent. I spoke to him to find out what I needed for my database system which I decided to call Rockford Auto Luxury Car Rentals. He told me about their rental process from start to finish. He talked about how customers pick out cars, how employees check to see if they are available, how the rentals are handled, and how payments are tracked. Based on his explanation, I decided to use customers, cars, employees, rentals, and payments as my tables. He said that every rental needs to have a clear connection between one customer, one car, and one employee, and that payments must always be linked to a specific rental for accountability. I used his experience to make a database that shows how a real luxury rental business works.
